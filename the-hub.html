        <h2 class="">Objective</h2>
        <p class="push-2">The client's rebrand objectives were to modernize The Hub's image while still feeling connected to the original brand. The Hub has a lot of history and emotional connection for a lot of people, therefore great care and consideration was needed when creating its new identity.</p>

        <h2 class="">Logo Design</h2>
        <p>We created logos for both The Hub and Rebound. We aimed to create a pair of logos that felt connected but also were unique and functioned on their own. For The Hub, we took the hub wheel from the original, simplified it, and gave it clean wordmark. For rebound, we made a matching wordmark with a simple rebounding U shape for a simple but effective extra detail.</p>

        <h2 class="">Web Design</h2>
        <p>For The Hub's new website, the most important factor was functionatlity and ease of use. The Hub's target audience are typically senoirs and other demographics that have limited computer experience. Therefore a focus was point on really clear grouping of content, easy navigation, and accessibility.</p>
        <p>A big goal of the website was to better tell The Hub's history and give clear details on their services. To accomplish this, we created a detailed about page, which tells the story of their history and makes it easy for users to find information about their history, services, donations, and board.</p>

    <h3>CMS Implementation</h3>
    <p class="cms-text push-2">To allow customizability of the website for the client, I implemeted <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="Learn more about building website with Netlify">Netlify</a>, a content management systems that builds the website with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Learn more about building website with Jekyll">Jekyll</a>.

        <p>The goal of The Hub's design was to modernize and simplify the brand and website. We created a strong, easily identifiable mark in the symbol that is versatile across all platforms.

      <h3>Typeface</h3>
      <p>The brand uses <strong>Omnes</strong> both in the wordmarks and for the headers on the website. The body copy is <strong>Open Sans</strong>, chosen for its strong readability.</p>

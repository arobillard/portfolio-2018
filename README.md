I am the kind of person who listens to a Dungeons & Dragons podcast while lacing up their skates in a hockey dressing room. I am equal parts passionate sports fan and massive nerd. I love learning new things, testing out theories, and discovering what is possible.

That’s why I love design. I get to be a huge nerd and spend hours on end coding this website from scratch (again, because I didn’t like the first one). I get to design the jerseys that fans cheer their favourite team on with. I get to meet new people and learn about their passions and make something awesome with them.

I am excited to hear what your passion is and how we can work together to create something amazing.

  shortDesc: A reimagining of the Québec Nordiques brand, updated to fit in the 2018 NHL design climate. It expands on the nordic symbolism while still remaining connected to its Francophone roots.
  longDesc: The goal of the Quebec Nordiques rebrand was to modernize the brand and have it stand out as a competitive brand in the modern age National Hockey League (NHL). The Quebec Nordiques team was relocateed to Colorado in the mid-1990s therefore their brand design reflects the 90s design style. The rebrand modernizes the team’s look while still feeling connected with the original brand.

        <h2 class="">Concept</h2>
        <p>The TopTable website is responsive and accessible, connecting all users across all devices. A big focus during the build of this website was allowing for easy tabbing through elements and obvious focus states. This improves the accessibility and makes navigating the website more efficient. TopTable is built from a pattern library, which creates cohesiveness in the design and functionality of the website through repetition of elements.</p>

        <h2 class="">Visual Design</h2>
        <p>The goal of TopTable's design was to focus on ease-of-use and to focus on the products. While reviewing other board game store websites, the competitive analysis showed a trend of having a large number of distracting graphics and design elements that made the sites both difficult to navigate and took emphasis away from the products. This design concept features clean, simple design elements with a large number of photos of the products. This returns the focus on the products so the user can easily find what they are searching for.</p>

      <h3>Typeface</h3>
      <p>Chosen for its simplicity and readablility, <strong>Roboto</strong> is a typeface that helps communicate well with the user without distraction.</p>
      <h4>Roboto</h4>

    <div class="unit [ xs-1 m-1-2 ] island push-2">
      <h3>Colours</h3>
      <p>The colour palette is simple and used sparingly. Colours are only used to create emphasis and to help seperate elements on the page.</p>

          <h3 class="">Images</h3>
          <p class="push-0">Product images feature a plain white background to focus on the products. They clearly display the various elements and pieces of the games so costumers can see the products they are buying. This style also allows the viewer to see the level design and craftmanship of the various products.</p>
